# Student Management System

<h3>Student Management System (SMS) </h3><br>
A robust, CLI-based Student Management System built with Python. This project manages student records using JSON for persistent data storage, implementing full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality with data validation.

<h3>Features</h3>
1- Add Student: Register new students with unique IDs (prevents duplicates).<br>
2- View Records: Search for a specific student by ID or view the entire database.<br>
3- Update Data: Edit existing student information (Name, Email, etc.) dynamically.<br>
4- Delete Records: Remove student data with a safety confirmation prompt.<br>
5- Data Persistence: Automatically saves all changes to a std.json file.<br>
6- Error Handling: Prevents crashes from invalid inputs or corrupted data files.<br>

<h3>System Architecture</h3><br>
This project was designed following professional software engineering principles:<br>
1. Use Case Diagram<br>
The system allows an Administrator to interact with the core database through five main operations.<br>
2. Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)<br>
The data is structured around the Student entity with the following attributes:
<code>std_ID (Primary Key / Unique)
std_name, std_fname, std_age, std_Email, std_phone, std_section</code><br>
3. Data Flow (DFD)<br>
Data flows from the user input through validation logic in Python before being committed to the std.json storage file.
